Hola there!

I am setting out on another adventure, one that will enable me to explore the depth and grace that assembly language brings to us. I know, for a fact
that is journey is going to be arduous, long and a real pain in the "arm"(get it? give me a lol, maybe? even if it's out of pity).

Nevertheless, "arm"-ed with x86 and NASM, I set forth. I warn you, in advance of the many, unfunny puns headed your way!
Wish me luck.....
