Introduction to Assembly
- Compiling -> Stacks -> Words -> Registers -> Flags -> Instructions

Stacks:
- our PC runs assembly and variables are stored in memory
- stack -> part of memory region -> stores variables -> LIFO
- stack grows upwards
- RSP = stack pointer -> decreased when we push something onto the stack and increased whe n we pop something off the stack
- RBP = base pointer -> points to the base of the current stack frame.
- every time we enter a function, a new stack frame is created, with the base pointer pointing to the bottom of the stack

Words:
- natural unit of data
- word = 2 bytes = 16 nits
- dword = 4 bytes
- qword = 8 bytes

Registers:
- store single values
- limited amount
- fast

Stacks:
- store many values
- can store a lot
- slow

Registers:
- have a size of 8 bytes
- 8 byte registers: rbp, rsp, rip, rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, r8,r9,r10,r11, r12, r13, r14, r15
- RSP = Stack Pointer
- RBP = Base Ponter
- RIP = Instruction Poiner -> points to the next instruction to be executed
- RBP(FULL 8 BYTES) -> EBP(LOWER 4 BYTES) -> BP(LOWER 2 BYTES) -> BPL(LOWEST BYTE)
- arguments are passed to functions using registers in this order -> rdi -> rsi -> rdx -> rcx -> r8 -> r9  ---> for 64 bit systems
- in 32 bit systems, variables are stored in a stack

Flags:
- something that can be true/false
- carry, parity, adjust, zero, sign, trap, interrupt, direction, overflow, nested task, resume flag

Common Instructions in Assembly
- push -> grow the stack by 8 bytes
- pop -> pop an 8 byte value into register supplied
- jmp -> jump to a function
- jnz -> jump if not zero (is zero flag not set?)
- jz -> jump if zero (is zero flag set?)
- mov
  > - mov rax, rdx ; move contents of rdx into rax
  > - mov rax, [rdx] ; [] -> pointer/ dereference -> take the value pointed into rax 
- lea
  > - calculates address of second operand and moves it into the first
- add -> adds and stores into the first registers
- sub
- xor, and, or -> binary operation      
- call, ret -> used for functions 
  > - when calling a function, push rbp and rip to the stack to execute functions
  > - when returning from a function, pop rbp and rip from the stack. Parent function now knows where to continue
- cmp -> used to compare -> same as sub, but doesn't store the result
-
