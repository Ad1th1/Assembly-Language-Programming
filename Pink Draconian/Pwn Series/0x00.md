Introduction to Assembly
- Compiling -> Stacks -> Words -> Registers -> Flags -> Instructions



Additional Information:
- Use objdump to get assembly code for a program
- our PC runs assembly and variables are stored in memory
- stack -> part of memory region -> stores variables -> LIFO
- stack grows upwards
- RSP = stack pointer -> decreased when we push something onto the stack and increased whe n we pop something off the stack
- RBP = base pointer -> points to the base of the current stack frame.
- every time we enter a function, a new stack frame is created, with the base pointer pointing to the bottom of the stack
