Introduction to Assembly
- Compiling -> Stacks -> Words -> Registers -> Flags -> Instructions

Stacks:
- our PC runs assembly and variables are stored in memory
- stack -> part of memory region -> stores variables -> LIFO
- stack grows upwards
- RSP = stack pointer -> decreased when we push something onto the stack and increased whe n we pop something off the stack
- RBP = base pointer -> points to the base of the current stack frame.
- every time we enter a function, a new stack frame is created, with the base pointer pointing to the bottom of the stack

Words:
- natural unit of data
- word = 2 bytes = 16 nits
- dword = 4 bytes
- qword = 8 bytes

Registers:
- store single values
- limited amount
- fast

Stacks:
- store many values
- can store a lot
- slow

Registers:
- have a size of 8 bytes
- 8 byte registers: rbp, rsp, rip, rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, r8,r9,r10,r11, r12, r13, r14, r15
- RSP = Stack Pointer
- RBP = Base Ponter
- RIP = Instruction Poiner -> points to the next instruction to be executed
- RBP(FULL 8 BYTES) -> EBP(LOWER 4 BYTES) -> BP(LOWER 2 BYTES) -> BPL(LOWEST BYTE)
- arguments are passed to functions using registers in this order -> rdi -> rsi -> rdx -> rcx -> r8 -> r9  ---> for 64 bit systems
- in 32 bit systems, variables are stored in a stack

Flags:
- something that can be true/false
- carry, parity, adjust, zero, sign, trap, interrupt, direction, overflow, nested task, resume flag
-
